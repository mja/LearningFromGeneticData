# What is a *“common”*, *“complex”* psychiatric disorder?

**Common:** Affects 1% or more of the population  
**Complex:** Inheritance cannot be explained by a single gene

Psychiatric disorders are defined by disruption to higher-order brain
functions of moods, perceptions, thoughts, beliefs, and behaviours but
usually in the absence of major neurological impairments (consciousness,
senses, memory). Psychiatric disorders include depressive and anxiety
disorders (major depressive disorder, panic disorder), manic and
psychotic disorders (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia),
obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa), substance-use disorders and personality disorders.
Childhood conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity and autism can
also be included, but only when they lead to clinically-salient
impairment or distress. There are also many shades of sadness,
hallucinations, eccentricities, mood swings, body-image preoccupations,
recreational substances use, personalities, etc that are not psychiatric
disorders but may still be informative to study from an aetiological and
genetic standpoint.

- Depression: 3% in a week
- Schizophrenia: 1% in lifetime
- Bipolar disorder: 2% in lifetime
- Anxiety disorder: 6% in a week

<div class="notes">

Psychiatric disorders have many causes, correlates, and consequences
(genetics, environment, family life, substance use, relationships)

Incidence of psychiatric disorders range from the common (depression,
anxiety) to the rare (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia).

# Why genetics?

Why use genetics to study mental health and psychiatric disorders?

- Biological understanding of genes, pathways
- Shared aetiology with other disorders
- Risk prediction
- Drug retargeting
- Causal analysis of environmental risk factors

## Genetics of categorical traits

![Diagram showing the seven “characters” observed by
Mendel](assets/Mendel_seven_characters.svg)

<div class="notes">

Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), working in what is now Czechia, discovered
the transmission of traits from parents to offspring could be explained
by the inheritance of two “elements”, which we now call alleles. Mendel
was concerned with discrete or categorical phenotypes.

## Genetics of continuous traits

<div class="notes">

Separately, Francis Galton (1822–1911), was studying the inheritance of
continuous or metric phenotypes. He noticed the parents who were tall
tended to have children that were slightly shorter than themselves (and
vice versa). This was termed “regression to the mean” from which the
name of the statistical method “regression” is derived.

> the associated parameters had scientific meaning for them that went

<div class="notes">

Ronald Fisher reconciled the inheritance of continuous and categorical
phenotypes by showing that a continuous phenotype could be made from the
inheritance of a large number (dozens, hundreds, or thousands)
categorical genes. The term “variance” comes from Fisher’s discoveries.

## Polygenic traits are quantitative traits

Adding up effects from a large number of genetic effects to make a
continuous phenotype is related to the Central Limit Theorem.

# Biometrics

## What are the sources of family resemblance? How do we quantify them numerically?

## Heritability

Proportion of similarity in phenotypes that can be attributed to
similarity in genotypes. **Model:** Phenotype (P) = Genotype (G) +
Environment (E)  
**Variance decomposition** $$var(P) = var(𝐺) + var(𝐸)$$ **Proportion of
variance** $$h^2 = \frac{var(𝐺)}{var(𝑃)}$$
