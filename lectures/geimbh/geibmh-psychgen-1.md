# What is a *“common”*, *“complex”* psychiatric disorder?

**Common:** Affects 1% or more of the population  
**Complex:** Inheritance cannot be explained by a single gene

Psychiatric disorders are defined by disruption to higher-order brain
functions of moods, perceptions, thoughts, beliefs, and behaviours but
usually in the absence of major neurological impairments (consciousness,
senses, memory). Psychiatric disorders include depressive and anxiety
disorders (major depressive disorder, panic disorder), manic and
psychotic disorders (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia),
obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa), substance-use disorders and personality disorders.
Childhood conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity and autism can
also be included, but only when they lead to clinically-salient
impairment or distress. There are also many shades of sadness,
hallucinations, eccentricities, mood swings, body-image preoccupations,
recreational substances use, personalities, etc that are not psychiatric
disorders but may still be informative to study from an aetiological and
genetic standpoint.

- Depression: 3% in a week
- Schizophrenia: 1% in lifetime
- Bipolar disorder: 2% in lifetime
- Anxiety disorder: 6% in a week

<div class="notes">

Psychiatric disorders have many causes, correlates, and consequences
(genetics, environment, family life, substance use, relationships)

Incidence of psychiatric disorders range from the common (depression,
anxiety) to the rare (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia).

# Why genetics?

Why use genetics to study mental health and psychiatric disorders?

- Biological understanding of genes, pathways
- Shared aetiology with other disorders
- Risk prediction
- Drug retargeting
- Causal analysis of environmental risk factors

## Genetics of categorical traits

<div class="notes">

Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), working in what is now Czechia, discovered
the transmission of traits from parents to offspring could be explained
by the inheritance of two “elements”, which we now call alleles. Mendel
was concerned with discrete or categorical phenotypes.
